## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the Adventure Works Database to gain insights into various business operations. This involves writing SQL queries to extract and analyze data, and visualizing the results to derive meaningful insights.

## Database Structure
The Adventure Works Database includes various tables representing different aspects of a business, such as:

- **Sales**: `SalesOrderHeader`, `SalesOrderDetail`
- **Products**: `Product`, `ProductCategory`, `ProductModel`
- **Customers**: `Customer`, `CustomerAddress`
- **Employees**: `Employee`, `EmployeeDepartmentHistory`
- **Others**: `Address`, `Vendor`, `PurchaseOrderHeader`

## Data Analysis and Queries
This section includes SQL queries that perform various data analysis tasks.

### Sales Analysis
- **Total Sales by Year**:
  ```sql
  SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year, SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalSales
  FROM SalesOrderHeader
  GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
  ORDER BY Year;


#### 7. Results and Visualizations
